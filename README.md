To run this repository, currently the website doesn't have all the features. To run, install next.js, pull the github repo to a
repository, and run npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @google/generative-ai and other dependencies.

Now, run the python file sCaspHandler.py (one way to do this is to navigate to the file, and click the run button at the top right in vs code).

Next, run npm run dev in the terminal, and go to localhost.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Note: if using windows, one will probably need to install WSL, and then install ciao and s(CASP) into WSL, because the python code relies on running s(CASP) commands from the terminal.
